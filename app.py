        Suraksha utilizes cutting-edge machine learning models to ensure accurate incident detection and context understanding. 
        Our application integrates two distinct models:
        
        1. **YOLOv9 Pre-Trained Model**: This model has been fine-tuned on our custom dataset comprising over 1200+ images. 
           It provides a severity score for incidents based on the uploaded image, helping gauge the level of urgency required for each situation.
        
        2. **Google Gemini Model**: Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini Model, a detailed description is generated, providing a comprehensive context 
           of the incident depicted in the image. This ensures that not only the severity but the full context of the event is understood.

    st.write("""
        Our first model is based on the YOLOv9 architecture, specifically fine-tuned for incident severity detection. Let's break down its core features and functionality:

        - **Fine-Tuning**: The YOLOv9 model has been meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of over 1200+ incident images. By adjusting the weights and optimizing the learning parameters, we have trained the model to recognize and classify the severity of all kinds of  incidents with a high degree of accuracy.
        
        - **Severity Scoring**: Upon processing an image, the model generates a severity score that classifies the detected incidents. The severity can range from minor (low impact) to severe (high impact), helping decision-makers quickly gauge the criticality of the incident.
        
        - **Real-Time Inference**: One of the strongest features of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, including YOLOv9, is its ability to perform real-time inference. This means that the model can quickly process images and return accurate results in a matter of milliseconds, making it an ideal tool for real-world applications where timely responses are crucial.

        Below is a sample Python code demonstrating how we can use the YOLOv9 model for incident severity detection:

    ### Code Breakdown and Explanation:

    1. **Imports**:
        - **argparse**: Helps with parsing command-line arguments (though unused in this snippet, useful for expanding the script).
        - **os**: Provides interaction with the operating system (to manipulate paths, directories, etc.).
        - **torch**: This is the main PyTorch library, used for loading the model, handling tensors, and running the model on either CPU or GPU.
        - **pathlib.Path**: A more Pythonic way to handle paths and directories.
        - **collections.Counter**: A utility to count occurrences of incident classes predicted by the model.
        - **DetectMultiBackend**: This is a YOLOv9-specific utility that loads and handles the model for inference.
        - **LoadImages**: A YOLO utility to load images for inference.
        - **non_max_suppression**: A critical function that helps remove redundant bounding boxes based on Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.
        - **LOGGER**: A logging utility to display useful information about the inference process.

    2. **`run` function**:
        This function is where the core inference happens. It takes in several arguments:
        - `weights`: The path to the trained YOLOv9 model weights (e.g., `best.pt`).
        - `source`: The path where the images to be processed are located.
        - `conf_thres`: The confidence threshold‚Äîany prediction below this value is discarded.
        - `iou_thres`: The Intersection over Union threshold for non-max suppression, controlling how overlapping predictions are handled.

    3. **Model Loading**:
        ```python
        device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
        model = DetectMultiBackend(weights, device=device)
        ```
        The model is loaded into the appropriate device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU). Using the GPU can significantly speed up inference, especially for large-scale real-time image processing.

    4. **Image Loading**:
        ```python
        dataset = LoadImages(source)
        ```
        This line sets up the image loader. It reads images from the [`source`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FProjects%2FSurakshaV2%2FDocumentation%2Fapp.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A104%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%2C%22dcd69879-541f-4f72-9523-83961bb0a4f7%22%5D "Go to definition") directory for inference. The [`LoadImages`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FProjects%2FSurakshaV2%2FDocumentation%2Fapp.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A84%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%22dcd69879-541f-4f72-9523-83961bb0a4f7%22%5D "Go to definition") utility ensures that images are preprocessed correctly before being fed into the model.

    5. **Running Inference**:
        ```python
        for path, im, im0s, s in dataset:
            im = torch.from_numpy(im).to(device).float() / 255.0
            pred = model(im)
            det = non_max_suppression(pred, conf_thres, iou_thres)
        ```
        This section processes each image, performs inference, and applies non-max suppression to filter out redundant predictions.

    6. **Counting Detected Classes**:
        ```python
        for *xyxy, conf, cls in reversed(det):
            class_counter[model.names[int(cls)]] += 1
        ```
        Detected classes are counted using the `Counter` utility. The most frequently detected class is considered the primary result.

    7. **Logging**:
        ```python
        most_common_class = class_counter.most_common(1)[0][0] if class_counter else "No_incident"
        LOGGER.info(f"Detected class: {most_common_class}")
        ```
        Finally, the most common class detected across all images is logged.

    1. **WebSockets for Persistent Connection**: Suraksha's backend utilizes WebSockets to establish a persistent connection between the client (mobile or web) and the server, ensuring real-time communication for image uploads and location data.
    
    2. **Redis Queue**: When an image is uploaded, it is sent to a Redis queue. The Redis queue ensures that no upload is missed, efficiently managing the flow of data including the image URL, longitude, and latitude.
    
    3. **Frontend and Backend Synchronization**: The uploaded image is showcased both on the backend (for processing) and on the frontend (for user visualization) in real time, creating a seamless user experience.
    
    4. **Redis Queue Policies**: The Redis queue implements policies that trigger the next step in the flow by sending the data to a worker process for further processing.
    
    5. **Worker for ML Model Processing**: The worker runs machine learning models, including YOLOv9, which generate two key outputs: the severity score of the incident and an image description response.

    6. **PostgreSQL Database with Prisma ORM**: Once the machine learning model generates the severity score and description, the results are saved to a PostgreSQL database. Prisma ORM is used for seamless database management, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage.

    7. **End-to-End Real-Time System**: This entire backend flow allows Suraksha to efficiently handle real-time incident reporting, from image upload to severity analysis and data storage, all while ensuring that no crucial data is lost in the process.
