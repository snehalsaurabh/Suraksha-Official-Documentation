# üß† Machine Learning - Suraksha

![Suraksha ML Models](Assets/Suraksha.jpg)

## üöÄ Overview of Machine Learning Models in Suraksha

Suraksha utilizes cutting-edge machine learning models to ensure accurate incident detection and context understanding. Our application integrates two distinct models:

1. **YOLOv9 Pre-Trained Model**: This model has been fine-tuned on our custom dataset comprising over 1200+ images. It provides a severity score for incidents based on the uploaded image, helping gauge the level of urgency required for each situation.

2. **Google Gemini Model**: Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini Model, a detailed description is generated, providing a comprehensive context of the incident depicted in the image. This ensures that not only the severity but the full context of the event is understood.

![YOLOv9](Assets/YoloV9.jpeg)

## üîç How the YOLOv9 Model Works

Our first model is based on the YOLOv9 architecture, specifically fine-tuned for incident severity detection. Let's break down its core features and functionality:

- **Fine-Tuning**: The YOLOv9 model has been meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of over 1200+ incident images. By adjusting the weights and optimizing the learning parameters, we have trained the model to recognize and classify the severity of all kinds of incidents with a high degree of accuracy.

- **Severity Scoring**: Upon processing an image, the model generates a severity score that classifies the detected incidents. The severity can range from minor (low impact) to severe (high impact), helping decision-makers quickly gauge the criticality of the incident.

- **Real-Time Inference**: One of the strongest features of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, including YOLOv9, is its ability to perform real-time inference. This means that the model can quickly process images and return accurate results in a matter of milliseconds, making it an ideal tool for real-world applications where timely responses are crucial.

Below is a sample Python code demonstrating how we can use the YOLOv9 model for incident severity detection:

``python
import argparse
import os
import torch
from pathlib import Path
from collections import Counter
from models.common import DetectMultiBackend
from utils.dataloaders import LoadImages
from utils.general import non_max_suppression, LOGGER

def run(weights='yolo.pt', source='data/images', conf_thres=0.25, iou_thres=0.45):
    # Load model
    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    model = DetectMultiBackend(weights, device=device)
    
    # Load images
    dataset = LoadImages(source)
    
    class_counter = Counter()  # Class occurrence counter
    
    # Run inference
    for path, im, im0s, s in dataset:
        im = torch.from_numpy(im).to(device).float() / 255.0  # Preprocessing
        pred = model(im)  # Model inference
        det = non_max_suppression(pred, conf_thres, iou_thres)
        
        # Count detected classes
        for *xyxy, conf, cls in reversed(det):
            class_counter[model.names[int(cls)]] += 1

    most_common_class = class_counter.most_common(1)[0][0] if class_counter else "No_incident"
    LOGGER.info(f"Detected class: {most_common_class}")
